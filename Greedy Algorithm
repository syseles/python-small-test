#Greedy Algorithm - Optimal Task Assignment
#[6, 3, 2, 7, 5, 5] - correspond to hours for one task
#find optimal way assign to 3 workers (all 2)
# task independent
#min time in total
#Brute Force: Enumerate every possible pair
#Greedy Algorithm: Pair longest task with shortest one
# Time complexity is O(n log n) (due to sorting)
